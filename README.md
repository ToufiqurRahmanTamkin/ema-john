# Ema-John-Client-Side
This is an E-commerce based web application, which I was developed so that one user can buy products using this application.
Here all data of the home page are coming from the MongoDB database which is added by an admin.
This application is fully functional. This application is also responsive for computer screens.
One user can add products to their cart. From the cart, the user can review products again and there is a private route and the user have to be a logged-in user to review products.
From the review, section the user can remove the products from the cart. After that user will click on the process checkout and then the user has to provide the shipment address and complete payment. The payment was implemented using stripe. After that, the order is stored in the database with user details and order Id.

To develop this application I have used MongoDB, reactJS, nodeJS, and ExpressJS. I also use firebase auth for authentication. You can find my repository by clicking on the button below
